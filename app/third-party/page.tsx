            <p>
              Before we dive deeper into why RareBee Lifesciences is the right
              partner, let's first understand what third party pharmaceutical
              manufacturing is. In simple words, it's when a pharmaceutical
              company outsources the production of its medicines to a trusted
              manufacturer like us. This helps save on costs related to setting
              up your own manufacturing facilities while ensuring that you still
              get high-quality products that meet industry standards.
